# Enhanced DataTable Cross-Domain Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for validating the enhanced DataTable component across different business domains, based on advanced patterns extracted from the SGS Volunteers T-shirts module.

## Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Component Feature Testing

#### 1.1 Multi-Level Header System
**Test Cases:**
- Inventory tracking headers with dynamic counts
- Column grouping with badge indicators  
- Size-based allocation displays (S, M, L, XL, 2XL pattern)
- Real-time count updates

**Business Context Testing:**
- **Volunteer Management**: T-shirt sizes, meal allocations, role assignments
- **Student Data**: Grade categories, attendance periods, course sections
- **Alumni Networks**: Membership tiers, event categories, donation levels
- **Event Management**: Venue sections, time slots, resource types

#### 1.2 Inline Interactive Controls
**Test Cases:**
- Quantity editor functionality (+ / - buttons)
- Modal integration for bulk operations
- Smart validation with business rules
- Contextual action buttons

**Business Context Testing:**
- **Volunteer Management**: T-shirt quantity allocation, hours tracking
- **Student Data**: Grade adjustments, attendance marking
- **Alumni Networks**: Event registration counts, donation amounts
- **Event Management**: Capacity adjustments, resource allocation

#### 1.3 Visual Status Indicator System
**Test Cases:**
- Badge component with different states
- Color-coded status indicators
- Icon integration accuracy
- Hover states and progressive disclosure

**Business Context Testing:**
- **Volunteer Management**: Available/Assigned/Completed status
- **Student Data**: Pass/Fail/Pending status
- **Alumni Networks**: Active/Inactive/Pending membership
- **Event Management**: Available/Booked/Waitlist status

### Phase 2: Cross-Domain Validation

#### 2.1 Configuration-Driven Adaptation
**Test Scenarios:**
- Same component configuration across different data types
- Business rule validation consistency
- UI adaptation based on domain context
- Performance consistency across domains

#### 2.2 Data Type Compatibility
**Test Data Sets:**
- **Volunteer Management**: 500+ volunteers, 50+ events, 100+ resources
- **Student Data**: 1000+ students, 100+ courses, 500+ grades
- **Alumni Networks**: 2000+ alumni, 50+ events, 200+ mentorships  
- **Event Management**: 100+ events, 1000+ attendees, 50+ venues

### Phase 3: Performance & UX Testing

#### 3.1 Mobile Responsiveness
**Test Scenarios:**
- Touch interactions across all business domains
- Swipe gestures for bulk operations
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Responsive table layouts

#### 3.2 Performance Benchmarks
**Metrics to Track:**
- Load time consistency across domains
- Memory usage with large datasets
- Scroll performance with virtual scrolling
- Bundle size impact per domain

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('EnhancedDataTable', () => {
  describe('Volunteer Management Domain', () => {
    it('should render inventory headers correctly');
    it('should handle t-shirt allocation logic');
    it('should validate resource constraints');
  });
  
  describe('Student Data Domain', () => {
    it('should adapt to grade management context');
    it('should handle attendance tracking');
    it('should validate academic rules');
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
- Cross-domain component reusability
- API adapter integration consistency
- State management across domains
- Real-time update propagation

### E2E Tests
- Complete business workflows
- Multi-domain user interactions
- Performance under realistic load
- Accessibility compliance

## Success Criteria

### Component Reusability
- ✅ Same DataTable component works across 4+ business domains
- ✅ Configuration-driven adaptation without code changes
- ✅ Consistent performance across all contexts
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness maintained

### Business Domain Coverage
- ✅ **Volunteer Management**: Full workflow support
- ✅ **Student Data**: Academic process integration
- ✅ **Alumni Networks**: Member engagement features
- ✅ **Event Management**: Complete event lifecycle

### Performance Targets
- Load time: < 1.5s across all domains
- Memory usage: < 50MB with 1000+ records
- First interaction: < 200ms response time
- Mobile scroll: 60fps performance
