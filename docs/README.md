# Shared Documentation

This directory contains documentation that applies to **all prototype implementations**, ensuring consistency and knowledge sharing across different technical approaches.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### `/architecture/`
Common architectural patterns and design decisions that should be consistent across all prototypes:
- `three-layer-system.md` - Core architectural pattern
- `entity-management.md` - Entity system design
- `data-adapters.md` - Data adapter patterns
- `theme-system.md` - Design token architecture

### `/development/`
Development standards and best practices for all contributors:
- `coding-standards.md` - Code style and patterns
- `testing-strategy.md` - Testing approaches
- `performance-guidelines.md` - Performance optimization

### `/project-management/`
Project tracking and comparison tools:
- `prototype-comparison.md` - Feature comparison matrix
- `decision-framework.md` - When to use which prototype
- `lessons-learned.md` - Cross-prototype insights

## 🎯 Purpose

These shared documents serve as:
- **Single source of truth** for architectural decisions
- **Consistency guidelines** across all implementations
- **Knowledge repository** for lessons learned
- **Decision framework** for choosing appropriate prototypes

## 📝 Contributing

When working on any prototype:
1. **Follow** the patterns defined in `/architecture/`
2. **Adhere** to standards in `/development/`
3. **Update** relevant documents when you discover new patterns
4. **Share** insights in `/project-management/lessons-learned.md`

## 🔄 Maintenance

These documents should be updated when:
- New architectural patterns emerge
- Development standards evolve
- Cross-prototype insights are discovered
- Decision criteria change

*This shared documentation ensures all prototypes benefit from collective learning and maintain consistency in approach.*
