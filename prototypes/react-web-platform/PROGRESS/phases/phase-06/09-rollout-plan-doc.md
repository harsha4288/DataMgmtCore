# Phase 5.1: Production Rollout Plan

## Objective
Deploy token system to production with measured rollout, monitoring, and instant rollback capability.

## Performance Impact
- Bundle: 121KB → 27KB realized in production
- Runtime: 50ms theme switch achieved
- Mobile: Lighthouse score 95+ target met

## Key Decisions
1. **4-week phased rollout** - 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
2. **Feature flags via LaunchDarkly** - Component-level control
3. **Automated rollback triggers** - Performance/error thresholds
4. **A/B testing metrics** - Conversion impact measurement
5. **Regional rollout** - Start with low-traffic regions

## Implementation Approach
Progressive rollout with automatic monitoring and rollback triggers for safety.

### Example:
```javascript
/* Feature flag configuration */
{
  "design-tokens-v2": {
    "week1": { "percentage": 5, "regions": ["AU", "NZ"] },
    "week2": { "percentage": 25, "regions": ["AU", "NZ", "CA"] },
    "week3": { "percentage": 50, "regions": ["all-except-US"] },
    "week4": { "percentage": 100, "regions": ["all"] }
  }
}
```

## Rollout Timeline

### Week 0: Pre-Production (Feb 3-7)
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run load tests (10x normal traffic)
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Team training conducted

### Week 1: Soft Launch (Feb 10-14)
- **Traffic**: 5% in AU/NZ
- **Components**: Buttons, Cards only
- **Monitoring**: Every 15 minutes
- **Success Gate**: <0.1% error increase

### Week 2: Expansion (Feb 17-21)
- **Traffic**: 25% globally except US
- **Components**: +Forms, Tables
- **Monitoring**: Every 30 minutes
- **Success Gate**: Performance metrics maintained

### Week 3: Majority (Feb 24-28)
- **Traffic**: 50% all regions
- **Components**: All except critical paths
- **Monitoring**: Hourly
- **Success Gate**: No conversion impact

### Week 4: Full Rollout (Mar 3-7)
- **Traffic**: 100% all regions
- **Components**: All components
- **Monitoring**: Standard alerting
- **Success Gate**: All metrics improved

## Rollback Triggers

### Automatic Rollback If:
- Error rate increases >0.5%
- Page load time increases >10%
- Conversion rate drops >1%
- Memory usage increases >20%
- 3+ P1 bugs reported

### Manual Rollback Process:
1. Flip feature flag (immediate)
2. Clear CDN cache (2 min)
3. Verify metrics recovery (5 min)
4. Incident post-mortem (24 hrs)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Rollback Trigger |
|--------|----------|--------|------------------|
| Bundle Size | 121KB | <30KB | >40KB |
| FCP Mobile | 1.2s | <1.0s | >1.3s |
| Theme Switch | 200ms | <50ms | >100ms |
| Error Rate | 0.1% | 0.1% | >0.5% |
| Conversion | 3.2% | 3.2%+ | <3.1% |

## Communication Plan
- **Stakeholders**: Weekly status reports
- **Engineering**: Daily standup updates
- **Support**: FAQ and escalation paths
- **Users**: In-app notification for opt-out option

## Migration Path
- [ ] Configure feature flags
- [ ] Setup monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Prepare rollback runbooks
- [ ] Schedule go-live meetings
- [ ] Create incident response plan

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All rollback triggers tested
- [ ] Performance goals achieved
- [ ] Zero visual regressions
- [ ] Mobile metrics improved
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received

## Blocking Issues
- Feature flag service SLA concerns
- Holiday freeze period consideration
- Marketing campaign dependencies
