# Phase 5.2: Performance Monitoring & Alerts

## Objective
Track token system performance in production with real-time monitoring and regression detection.

## Performance Impact
- Bundle: Continuous monitoring of size
- Runtime: Real user metrics (RUM) tracking
- Mobile: Separate mobile performance dashboard

## Key Decisions
1. **Datadog for infrastructure monitoring** - APM and RUM combined
2. **Custom token-specific metrics** - Variable lookup performance
3. **Lighthouse CI for regression** - Automated on each deploy
4. **Sentry for error tracking** - Token-related errors tagged
5. **Grafana dashboards** - Business-visible metrics

## Implementation Approach
Multi-layer monitoring from build-time through runtime with automated alerting.

### Example:
```javascript
/* Performance tracking snippet */
// Track theme switch performance
performance.mark('theme-switch-start');
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark');
performance.mark('theme-switch-end');
performance.measure('theme-switch', 'theme-switch-start', 'theme-switch-end');

// Send to monitoring
analytics.track('token-performance', {
  metric: 'theme-switch',
  duration: performance.getEntriesByName('theme-switch')[0].duration,
  platform: detectPlatform()
});
```

## Key Metrics Dashboard

### Build-Time Metrics
| Metric | Alert Threshold | Check Frequency |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| CSS Bundle Size | >35KB | Every build |
| Token Count | >50 | Every build |
| Build Duration | >5min | Every build |
| Unused Tokens | >10% | Daily |

### Runtime Metrics
| Metric | Alert Threshold | Check Frequency |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Theme Switch Time | >75ms | Real-time |
| Variable Lookups/sec | >1000 | Real-time |
| FCP Mobile | >1.2s | Real-time |
| CSS Parse Time | >50ms | Real-time |

### Business Metrics
| Metric | Alert Threshold | Check Frequency |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Conversion Rate | <3.1% | Hourly |
| Bounce Rate | >35% | Hourly |
| Page Views/Session | <4.5 | Daily |
| Support Tickets | >10/day | Daily |

## Alert Configuration

### P1 Alerts (Page immediately)
- Bundle size increase >50%
- Theme switching broken
- Mobile FCP >2s
- Error rate >1%

### P2 Alerts (Notify on-call)
- Performance degradation >25%
- Token lookup failures
- Build pipeline failure
- Visual regression detected

### P3 Alerts (Team channel)
- Unused tokens >15%
- Build time >7min
- Documentation out of sync

## Mobile-Specific Monitoring

### Core Web Vitals (Mobile)
- LCP: <2.5s (target: <2.0s)
- FID: <100ms (target: <50ms)
- CLS: <0.1 (target: <0.05)

### Device Breakdown
- Monitor separately: iOS Safari, Chrome Android
- Track by connection: 3G, 4G, WiFi
- Device categories: Low-end, Mid-range, High-end

## Regression Detection

### Automated Checks
```yaml
# Lighthouse CI config
checks:
  - performance: 95
  - accessibility: 100
  - best-practices: 100
  - bundle-size: 30000
```

### Visual Regression
- Percy/Chromatic integration
- Threshold: 0.1% difference
- Components tested: All in pattern library
- Frequency: Every PR and deploy

## Historical Tracking

### Metrics to Archive
- Daily performance summaries
- Weekly trend reports
- Monthly executive dashboard
- Quarterly optimization opportunities

### Data Retention
- Raw metrics: 30 days
- Aggregated: 1 year
- Reports: Indefinite

## Migration Path
- [ ] Setup Datadog RUM
- [ ] Configure Lighthouse CI
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Setup alert channels
- [ ] Train on-call team

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All metrics collecting data
- [ ] Alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Dashboards accessible to stakeholders
- [ ] Mobile metrics separated
- [ ] Historical baselines captured

## Blocking Issues
- Datadog agent installation on edge servers
- Lighthouse CI infrastructure costs
- GDPR compliance for RUM data

## Performance Tracking Table

| Metric | Baseline | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 4 | Target | ✓/✗ |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Bundle Size | 121KB | | | | 30KB | |
| Load Time | 1.2s | | | | 1.0s | |
| Theme Switch | 200ms | | | | 50ms | |
| Mobile Score | 72 | | | | 95 | |
