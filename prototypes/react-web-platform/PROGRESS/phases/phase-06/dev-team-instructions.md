# Developer Team Documentation Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides instructions for creating the remaining .md files for phases 2-5 of the design token implementation.

## Documentation Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Brevity Over Completeness** - Focus on decisions, not full implementations
2. **Examples Over Explanations** - Show small before/after snippets
3. **Performance First** - Always include performance impact
4. **Mobile Priority** - Document mobile considerations explicitly
5. **Validation Required** - Every phase needs measurable outcomes

## Template for Remaining .md Files

```markdown
# Phase X.Y: [Title]

## Objective
[1-2 sentences maximum on what this achieves]

## Performance Impact
- Bundle: [size before] → [size after] 
- Runtime: [specific metric change]
- Mobile: [specific optimization or concern]

## Key Decisions
1. [Decision 1 and rationale]
2. [Decision 2 and rationale]

## Implementation Approach
[High-level approach, no full code]

### Example:
\`\`\`css
/* Before */
.component { ... }  // 5 lines max

/* After */  
.component { ... }  // 5 lines max
\`\`\`

## Migration Path
- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
- [ ] Step 3

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Performance metric achieved
- [ ] No visual regression
- [ ] Mobile tested

## Blocking Issues
- [Any blockers or dependencies]

## Files to Create by Phase

### Phase 2: Optimized Token Structure
**Already Created:** `03-token-structure.md`

**Dev Team to Create:**
#### `04-build-pipeline.md`
- Focus: How tokens compile to CSS
- Key sections:
  - Webpack/Vite configuration snippets
  - Static vs dynamic token separation
  - Platform detection logic
  - Build time vs runtime tokens
- Performance metric: Bundle size reduction
- Example: Show compiled output for one token

### Phase 3: Component Token System
**Dev Team to Create:**

#### `05-component-patterns.md`
- Focus: Reusable patterns for common components
- Document patterns for:
  - Cards (elevation, padding, radius)
  - Forms (input, select, checkbox)
  - Modals (overlay, shadow, animation)
  - Buttons (all states and variants)
- Include mobile touch target sizes
- Example: One complete pattern (e.g., card)

#### `06-migration-strategy.md`
- Focus: How to migrate existing components
- Include:
  - Priority order (most-used first)
  - Backward compatibility approach
  - Rollback plan
  - A/B testing strategy
- Timeline estimate
- Risk assessment

### Phase 4: Cross-Platform Export
**Dev Team to Create:**

#### `07-platform-builds.md`
- Focus: Platform-specific optimizations
- Document:
  - React Native transformations
  - iOS (Swift) mappings
  - Android (Kotlin) mappings
  - Flutter considerations
- Example: One token in all platforms

#### `08-export-pipeline.md`
- Focus: Automation setup
- Include:
  - CI/CD integration
  - Version control strategy
  - Token documentation generation
  - Figma sync (if applicable)
- Tool recommendations

### Phase 5: Production Rollout
**Dev Team to Create:**

#### `09-rollout-plan.md`
- Focus: Deployment strategy
- Include:
  - Feature flag approach
  - Monitoring setup
  - Success metrics
  - Rollback triggers
- Timeline with milestones

#### `10-monitoring.md`
- Focus: Performance tracking
- Document:
  - Key metrics to track
  - Alert thresholds
  - Dashboard setup
  - Regression detection
- Include mobile-specific metrics

## Quick Reference Checklist

### For Each .md File:
- [ ] Keep under 200 lines
- [ ] Include performance metrics
- [ ] Add mobile considerations
- [ ] Provide 1-2 code examples max
- [ ] Link to next phase
- [ ] List validation criteria

### What NOT to Include:
- ❌ Full component code
- ❌ Complete CSS files
- ❌ Detailed implementation
- ❌ Library documentation
- ❌ Generic explanations

### What TO Include:
- ✅ Specific decisions made
- ✅ Performance improvements
- ✅ Migration risks
- ✅ Validation methods
- ✅ Quick examples

## Performance Tracking Table

Create this table in each file:

| Metric | Current | Target | Actual | ✓/✗ |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|-----|
| Bundle Size | | | | |
| Load Time | | | | |
| Theme Switch | | | | |
| Mobile Score | | | | |

## Questions to Answer in Each Phase

### Phase 2 (Build Pipeline):
- How do tokens compile?
- What's the build time impact?
- How to handle dev vs prod?

### Phase 3 (Components):
- Which patterns are reusable?
- What's the migration order?
- How to maintain compatibility?

### Phase 4 (Platforms):
- How to transform for each platform?
- What can't be automated?
- How to test across platforms?

### Phase 5 (Rollout):
- How to measure success?
- What could go wrong?
- How to rollback quickly?

## Review Gates

Before moving to next phase:
1. Performance goals met?
2. Mobile testing complete?
3. Team consensus on approach?
4. Documentation updated?
5. Validation dashboard working?

**Remember:** The goal is to create a performant, maintainable token system that works across all platforms. Keep documentation focused on decisions and outcomes, not implementation details.
