# Phase 3.2: Component Migration Strategy

## Objective
Migrate existing components to new token system with zero downtime and ability to rollback.

## Performance Impact
- Bundle: Progressive reduction as components migrate
- Runtime: No performance degradation during migration
- Mobile: Immediate gains for migrated components

## Key Decisions
1. **Feature flag per component group** - Independent rollout/rollback
2. **Parallel token systems** - Old and new coexist temporarily
3. **Traffic-based priority** - Migrate most-used components first
4. **A/B testing on 5% traffic** - Validate before full rollout

## Implementation Approach
Gradual migration with compatibility layer maintaining both token systems during transition.

### Example:
```css
/* Compatibility layer */
:root {
  /* New token */
  --color-surface: #ffffff;
  
  /* Legacy aliases (temporary) */
  --background: var(--color-surface);
  --card: var(--color-surface);
  --popover: var(--color-surface);
}
```

## Migration Priority Order

### Wave 1 (Week 1-2) - High Traffic
1. Button (10M daily interactions)
2. Card (8M daily views)
3. Input (5M daily interactions)
4. Table (3M daily views)

### Wave 2 (Week 3-4) - Medium Traffic
5. Modal (500K daily)
6. Badge (300K daily)
7. Select (250K daily)
8. Checkbox (200K daily)

### Wave 3 (Week 5-6) - Low Traffic
9. Alert (50K daily)
10. Tooltip (30K daily)
11. Progress (20K daily)
12. Remaining components

## Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback trigger**: >0.5% visual regression reports
- **Performance gate**: No component slower than baseline
- **Compatibility mode**: 30-day overlap period
- **Snapshot tests**: Before/after visual comparison

## Migration Path
- [ ] Setup feature flags infrastructure
- [ ] Create compatibility layer
- [ ] Migrate Wave 1 components
- [ ] A/B test at 5% traffic
- [ ] Progressive rollout to 100%
- [ ] Remove legacy tokens after 30 days

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Zero visual regressions
- [ ] Performance metrics maintained
- [ ] Feature flags working
- [ ] Rollback tested
- [ ] Mobile QA passed

## Blocking Issues
- Feature flag service capacity
- QA resource availability for testing
- Stakeholder approval for A/B testing
