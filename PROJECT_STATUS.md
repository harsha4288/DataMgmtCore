   - 📋 Smart validation with business rule integration

3. **Cross-Domain Business Testing Strategy**
   - ✅ Stock and News domains validated
   - 📋 **Volunteer Management**: T-shirt allocation, event scheduling, resource tracking
   - 📋 **Student Data**: Grade management, attendance, parent portal interactions  
   - 📋 **Alumni Networks**: Membership tracking, event registration, mentorship matching
   - 📋 **Event Management**: Capacity planning, resource allocation, registration handling

### **High Priority (Enhanced Business Domain Focus)**
1. **Visual Status Indicator System**
   - Extract badge patterns from SGS (`inventory-badge.tsx`)
   - Implement color-coded status indicators (available/issued/low stock)
   - Icon integration for visual data representation
   - Hover states and progressive disclosure

2. **Enterprise Bulk Operations Framework**
   - Selection state management across large datasets
   - Bulk action toolbar with contextual operations
   - Confirmation dialogs with impact preview
   - Undo/redo capability for bulk changes

3. **Component Reusability Validation**
   - Same enhanced DataTable across 4+ business contexts
   - Configuration-driven adaptation testing
   - Performance consistency across domain types
   - Mobile responsiveness with domain-specific data

## 🚨 Current Blockers & Risks (UPDATED)

### **✅ Major Blockers Resolved**
1. **✅ Demo Domain Implementation** - RESOLVED  
   - ✅ Stock dashboard now properly implemented in `src/domains/stocks/StockDashboard.tsx`
   - ✅ Architecture effectiveness successfully demonstrated
   - ✅ Component reusability validated with DataTable integration

2. **✅ Component Library Foundation** - RESOLVED
   - ✅ Core components built: DataTable (behaviors), Button/Input/Modal (ui)
   - ✅ Three-layer architecture patterns working and validated
   - ✅ Development efficiency proven with rapid StockDashboard creation

3. **✅ Environment Configuration** - RESOLVED

   - Environment configuration ready, just needs key insertion
   - Impact: Currently using realistic mock data, live data would enhance demo

2. **Additional Domain Examples** - Development velocity
   - Need News and User domains to demonstrate cross-domain reuse
   - DataTable component ready for reuse, should be rapid development
   - Impact: Limited to single domain demonstration currently
